# Water_Conflict
SESYNC Pursuit on water and conflict
THis is the GIThub project for the Socio-Environmental Synthesis Center (SESYNC) project called; A socio-environmental synthesis of the linkages between water scarcity induced conflict and land use/land cover change in Africa to enhance multi-scalar decision making.

##Project Description
Conflict is a debatable dimension of changing water resources. This is a complex relationship to
unravel because it involves environmental, social, and institutional dimensions with associated
feedbacks. Conflicts are likely as disagreements occur about the best way to adapt to evolving
water resources. Institutions are key to enforcing laws and regulations that govern natural
resources. In many parts of the world however, there are institutional failures, which compound
negative feedbacks between people and the environment.

This Pursuit will combine the expertise of social and environmental scientists, NGOs, and
government officials to examine where, when, how and why conflicts arise over water. The team
will synthetically analyze data about conflict events, environmental change, society, and
institutions to answer three research questions: 1) What are the spatio-temporal socioenvironmental dynamics of water scarcity and how are these dynamics linked with conflict
across urban and rural landscapes of Africa? 2) At what spatial scale do the linkages between
water scarcity and conflict operate? 3) How has and will climate change impact natural resource
availability in already water scarce regions, especially those vulnerable or with a history of
conflict?

Findings will be shared with the research community, and policy recommendations designed
collaboratively with government agencies and stakeholders in Africa. One of the major products
of this proposal is a web portal which will announce events and progress of the research team.
This portal will also be used to disseminate scholarly research products, white papers and
brochures for practitioners, as well as integrated datasets and code.
